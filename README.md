Commodity manufacturers are in need of raw materials for the production of industrial chemicals, which are usually not locally available. Big chemical manufacturers focus mainly on their production process and output. They distribute in bulk vessels and are sometimes not able to support commodity manufacturers for container loads. Additionally, some markets are difficult to penetrate owing to volume requirements and financing. In all we do, our goal is to support this process and build trusted relationships through client proximity, providing industry expertise to help our customers to meet their needs.

Our mission is to carry out chemical distribution services, especially to commodity industries in many parts of the world. Today, we are able to represent a constantly growing number of businesses that are serving a variety list of chemical product names and markets. Every month, we source and supply about 500-600 containers to our customers worldwide.
